# Introduction to Programming with C

This repo holds homework programs for University of Central Florida's COP 3223C Introduction to Programming with C class. Taken Fall of 2014, my freshman year of college. Instead of listing each exercise's purpose here, I'll leave it to you to read the description at the top of each source file.

These programs are here to keep in a central place, provide reference material, and sate the curiosity of anyone who wants to know the extent of my C knowledge. This is not intended to aid cheating of any kind.

## How to Run

### Linux
Open the terminal and compile:
<pre><code>gcc -o executable_name file_name.c</code></pre>
Run the program:
<pre><code>./executable_name></code></pre>
